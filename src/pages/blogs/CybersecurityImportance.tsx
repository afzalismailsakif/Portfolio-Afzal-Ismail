        In today's digital-first world, cybersecurity is no longer optional—it's a necessity. With increasing threats
        to data and digital systems, protecting your personal and organizational information is more critical than ever.
      </p>

      <h2>What is Cybersecurity?</h2>
      <p>
        Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These attacks
        typically aim to access, change, or destroy sensitive information, extort money, or interrupt normal business operations.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Cybersecurity Matters</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Protection</strong> – Prevent unauthorized access to personal and sensitive data.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Continuity</strong> – Ensure that operations are not disrupted by attacks like ransomware or DDoS.</li>
        <li><strong>Reputation Management</strong> – Avoid brand damage and loss of trust from customers and partners.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Compliance</strong> – Stay compliant with data protection laws like GDPR, HIPAA, and others.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Common Cyber Threats</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Phishing Attacks</li>
        <li>Malware and Ransomware</li>
        <li>Insider Threats</li>
        <li>Zero-day Exploits</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Best Practices for Staying Safe</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use strong, unique passwords and enable multi-factor authentication.</li>
        <li>Keep software and systems updated with the latest security patches.</li>
        <li>Back up important data regularly.</li>
        <li>Educate employees and users on security awareness.</li>
      </ul>
